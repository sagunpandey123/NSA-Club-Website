##  Project Tandav
### This is a multi-purpose web application for the Nepalese Club Association (NSA) at The City College of New York.
 - This website is a platform for Nepalese freshmen students to be guided or mentored by Junior 
or Senior club members. 

 - It will be used as a platform where students can post any kind of announcement or statement.
 
     (Notice that the post will be first verified by the team leader before it is posted to protect the
     website from inappropriate and unacceptable posts. )
